2.1 Problem Statement
In this exercise, you will implement an anomaly detection algorithm to detect anomalous behavior in server computers.

The dataset contains two features -

throughput (mb/s) and
latency (ms) of response of each server.
While your servers were operating, you collected 
 examples of how they were behaving, and thus have an unlabeled dataset 
.

You suspect that the vast majority of these examples are “normal” (non-anomalous) examples of the servers operating normally, but there might also be some examples of servers acting anomalously within this dataset.
You will use a Gaussian model to detect anomalous examples in your dataset.

You will first start on a 2D dataset that will allow you to visualize what the algorithm is doing.
On that dataset you will fit a Gaussian distribution and then find values that have very low probability and hence can be considered anomalies.
After that, you will apply the anomaly detection algorithm to a larger dataset with many dimensions.
